### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22yo engineering student from Paris currently living in California. 
I've been practicing user experience design for few years now, but my journey with coding began in 2022, and I started exploring web development in 2023. I've decided to specialize myself in front-end development because I know how infuriating a bad UI can be, but I'm also able to do full-stack too. Oh and recently, I've explored TensorFlow and built my first neural network, capable of running directly in a browser. 
Driven by a passion for perfection, I spend a lot of time refining every aspect of my UI designs and actively search for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer and human being.
